        <h4>Comapny Laboratory, LLC</h4>
          <h5>May 2015 - Present</h5>
           <h4>Project Manager, Partner</h4>
        </br>
          <p>I'm Project Managing for startups focused in cloud-based mobile tutoring, online crowdfunding, and others. I determine the project plan and feature rollout, manage client relations day-to-day, and find opportunities to make budgets and timelines more efficient. Colab is an innovative venture studio based in Los Angeles that partners with and grows a select portfolio of strategic companies. We often serve as a hands-on co-founder, bringing advanced expertise in technology, web and mobile development, branding, strategy and business development, exclusive investor networks, UX, UI, and growth hacking.</p>

            <li class="startupli">Pundits</li>
              <h5>October 2015 - Present</h5>
                <p>Pundits is an on-demand mobile app that brings students and tutors together. Students can easily submit a homework question and watch their question be answered in real-time via livestream by tutors on the platform. Pundits has made tutoring more convenient than ever for both students and tutors. Our team built a mobile application that interact together seamlessly through the Pundits app. The Student snaps a photo of their homework. The Pundits cloud connects student and tutor in a live-session. And the solution is archived, tagged, and accessible to other students.</p>

            <li class="startupli">StartEngine</li>
              <h5>November 2015 - September 2016</h5>
                <p>StartEngine is the future of startup investing. Our team took the platform from a static HTML site to SEC ready in just a few months. The platform seamlessly manages the transition, holding, and distribution of funds through the FundAmerica API. Since the launch in November 2015, the platform has raised over $15M+ in funding for startup founders. We built a software application that assists startups in registering their company with StartEngine, building a personalized profile, receiving SEC approval, and exchanging reserved shares for equity with StartEngine users.</p>

            <li class="startupli">AgePath</li>
              <h5>August 2015 - January 2016</h5>
                <p>AgePath connects families-in-need with eldercare providers. We’ve enabled Eldercare providers to place a custom booking widget on their personal site, schedule availability for their employees, and track bookings through a custom back-end CRM platform. Consumers can find the closest eldercare providers in their zipcode and book appointments instantly for their loved ones through AgePath. One of the biggest insights we found was that consumers are 19 times more likely to commit to a booking when a provider has an online reservation system. We created a real-time booking software, marketing network, and care navigation platform. Consumer-facing site that serves as a Eldercare Resource Tool to help users find the best and Providers of elder care can quickly and easily sort/manage their client contact list with the custom CRM service we built with AgePath.</p>

            <li class="startupli">Mooch</li>
              <h5>June 2015 - September 2016</h5>
                <p>Mooch is making collaborating with students easier. Mooch puts the classroom in your pocket, and allows students to share notes, create study groups, and easily connect with classmates. The team at Mooch recognized a huge problem at schools across the country—collaborating with other students in your classroom is difficult and inefficient with current technology. Working, collaborating, and sharing with those around you means better test score for everyone, and who doesn’t want that? Our development team chose to create a single-page app built on Meteor.js. What makes this framework a step above the rest is it’s super-smooth interface. Mooch’s easy-to-learn and easier-to-master interface takes the focus away from the learning curve and puts the emphasis on learning in the classroom. Colab initiated the planning of the project and executed development, and collaborated with the Mooch team on the design and UX. Once we had a design that could be aligned with our priorities, Colab took over control of development and executed the creation of Mooch.</p>

During my time, I developed and grew relationships with major advertising agencies (Leo Burnett, Cramer-Krasselt and Starcom MediaVest) that all eventually hired team members for full-time positions. Previously, there was little to no professional networking opportunities with advertising agencies at my university.</p>

              After grabbing information on WHO is interested in your product, <span class="highlight">you need to go deeper and understand WHY they are interested</span>.

          <p class="jams">This is the route I like to take if I'm up early enough to get a spin in before work. It heads up the always nice Franklin Canyon and has some decently open road if you're there early. Beware after 5PM-- lots of traffic.</p>

          <p class="jams">Best route I've taken through Los Angeles thus far. ~9 mile spin to get out to PCH, then you're free to fly. One of the quietly cooler parts about riding on PCH is how friendly everyone is about grouping up. I've met some really awesome people by grabbing a wheel and trading pulls. Pack some food, this route takes me around 4 hours and 20 minutes.</p>
